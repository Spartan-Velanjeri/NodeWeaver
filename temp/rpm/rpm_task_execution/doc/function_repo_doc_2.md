# Function Repo Doc 2 (MD)

For markdown help here.

## Subsequent Headline

in `*.md` take care of `#`, `##`, `###`, ... subsequent Headings

in `vscode` use the extensions

- `DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint`
- `yzhang.markdown-all-in-one`

### Sample Heading

The numbering (turn on/off) in Headlines is controlled by the
`.. toctree::` directive in `index.rst` when you see the `:numbered: 3` parameter (for depth 3)

#### Line Breaks vs auto-format

Line breaks in `.md` are created 2 x ' ' (space) at end of line.
saving file often removes trailing white-space (auto-format)
at end-of-line - what removes intended line-break.
> come out of this

    hallo  \
    world  \
becomes:

halli  \
hallo  \
world  \
